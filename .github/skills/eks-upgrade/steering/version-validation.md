# Version Validation & Upgrade Path

## Purpose
Validate the upgrade path, determine support status, and enforce EKS upgrade rules.

## EKS Version Support Calendar (fallback reference, as of June 2026)

> **Freshness gate — apply BEFORE using this table:**
> 1. If the cluster version or target version is **NOT in the table below** → fetch live
>    data from AWS docs (`search_documentation` for "EKS Kubernetes versions") before proceeding.
> 2. If today's assessment date is **past the "Standard Support Until" date** for the cluster's
>    current version → that version has moved from STANDARD to EXTENDED support (extended-support
>    pricing and an extended-support INFO finding now apply). The table's STANDARD/EXTENDED labels
>    go stale the moment a standard-support window closes, so verify the row's Status live against
>    AWS docs (EKS `kubernetes-versions.html`) before reporting.
> 3. If today's assessment date is **past the "Extended Support Until" date** for the cluster's
>    current version → that version's status may have changed to UNSUPPORTED. Verify live before
>    reporting support status.
> 4. If live lookup fails or the MCP server is unavailable → use the table as fallback, but add
>    a note in the report: "Support status unverified — table data may be stale."

| Version | Standard Support Until | Extended Support Until | Status |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|--------|
| 1.36 | August 2, 2027 | August 2, 2028 | ✅ STANDARD (latest in this table) |
| 1.35 | March 27, 2027 | March 27, 2028 | ✅ STANDARD |
| 1.34 | December 2, 2026 | December 2, 2027 | ✅ STANDARD |
| 1.33 | July 29, 2026 | July 29, 2027 | ⚠️ EXTENDED (standard support ended July 29, 2026; extended as of 2026-08-05 — verify live) |
| 1.32 | March 23, 2026 | March 23, 2027 | ⚠️ EXTENDED |
| 1.31 | November 26, 2025 | November 26, 2026 | ⚠️ EXTENDED |
| 1.30 | July 23, 2025 | July 23, 2026 | ❌ UNSUPPORTED (extended support ended July 23, 2026; unsupported as of 2026-08-06 — verify live) |

> **Provenance:** calendar verified as of 2026-08-06 via https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html — re-verify live per the freshness gate above before reporting.

**CRITICAL:** The `upgradePolicy.supportType` field from the API is a CONFIGURATION PREFERENCE, not the current billing status. Always determine actual support status from the calendar above or from live AWS documentation.

**Cost impact:** Extended support has historically cost ~$0.60/hr vs ~$0.10/hr for standard support. These rates are indicative and subject to change — verify against the current [Amazon EKS pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/pricing/) before quoting figures to the user.

**Cost Calculation Formula (recompute with the current rates, do not hardcode):**
```
extra_cost_per_month = (extended_rate - standard_rate) × 730
total_extended_cost  = extended_rate × 730
total_standard_cost  = standard_rate × 730
# Example with the indicative rates above:
#   extra = (0.60 - 0.10) × 730 = ~$365/month per cluster
#   total_extended = 0.60 × 730 = ~$438/month per cluster
```
Always use this formula. Do NOT round, estimate, or hallucinate cost figures.
730 = average hours per month (365 days × 24 hours ÷ 12 months).

## Checks to Execute

### 1.0 — Target Version Existence (MUST run before other checks)

**Why:** EKS releases versions incrementally. A target version that doesn't exist on EKS yet
cannot be assessed. The arithmetic check (target - current == 1) is necessary but NOT sufficient.

**How to check:**
1. Confirm the target version exists in the calendar table above.
2. If NOT in the table → search AWS docs (`search_documentation` for "EKS Kubernetes versions")
   to confirm whether the version has been released on EKS.
3. If live lookup also finds no evidence the version exists on EKS → **ABORT the assessment.**

**If target version does not exist on EKS — STOP and report:**

```
## Assessment Cannot Proceed

**Target version <target> is not yet available on Amazon EKS.**

The latest supported EKS version is <latest_known>. Kubernetes <target> has not been
released on EKS as of this assessment date (<date>).

**What you can do:**
- Assess upgrade readiness to <latest_known> instead (if your cluster is on <latest - 1>)
- Monitor the EKS release calendar for <target> availability:
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html
```

Do NOT proceed with Steps 1-8. Do NOT produce a readiness score. End the assessment here.

### 1.1 — Current Version & Support Status

**How to check:**
1. Describe the cluster → get `version` and `platformVersion`
2. Match version against the calendar table above (applying the freshness gate)
3. Determine the support status. Possible states:
   - **STANDARD** — within standard support window
   - **EXTENDED** — past standard support, within extended support window
   - **UNSUPPORTED** — past extended support end date (see handling below)
4. Report: version, support status, when current support period ends (or already ended)

**UNSUPPORTED version handling:**

If the cluster version's Extended Support Until date has passed:
- Status = **UNSUPPORTED**
- Severity = **CRITICAL**
- Flag as a blocker in the report (see report-generation.md for template)
- The cluster no longer receives security patches or bug fixes from AWS
- AWS automatically upgrades the cluster to the next minor version at the end of extended support (see EKS docs, "extended support" / `kubernetes-versions.html`); the cluster does not remain on the unsupported version indefinitely
- Extended support billing (indicative ~$0.60/hr — verify current rate) applies throughout the extended-support window; it ends when the cluster leaves the extended-support version — either by a user-initiated upgrade or by AWS's automatic upgrade at end of extended support
- Score impact: 15 pts deduction (see report-generation.md §Category 10)

**Output:** Current version, support tier, cost implications. If UNSUPPORTED, include urgency callout.

### 1.2 — Upgrade Path Validation

**Rules:**
- EKS requires upgrading **one minor version at a time** (e.g., 1.30 → 1.31, not 1.30 → 1.32)
- A downgrade is not an assessment target for this forward-path logic — but reverting is not
  impossible: EKS Version Rollback (launched 2026-07) can revert the control plane to the
  previous minor version within **7 days** of an in-place upgrade, a single version only
  (N→N-1), via console/CLI/SDK (`aws eks update-cluster-version` with the N-1 version → update
  type `VersionRollback`), gated by `ROLLBACK_READINESS` cluster insights.
- Same-version "upgrades" are invalid

**How to check:**
1. Parse current version (from cluster describe) and target version (from user input)
2. Calculate version difference: `target_minor - current_minor`
3. If difference == 1: valid direct upgrade
4. If difference > 1: show required upgrade path (e.g., 1.29 → 1.30 → 1.31 → 1.32)
5. If difference <= 0: invalid (same version or downgrade)

**Output:** Valid/invalid path, required intermediate steps if multi-hop.

### 1.3 — Fargate Version Boundary

Fargate does not expose a customer-managed node-group upgrade path. AWS manages the
Fargate kubelet, operating system, and container runtime. Therefore this skill does not
calculate kubelet skew or recommend an AMI/runtime migration for a Fargate-only cluster.

**How to check:**
1. List Fargate profiles and describe each profile.
2. List managed node groups only to detect a hybrid cluster.
3. If no managed or self-managed node groups are present, mark node version readiness
  `N/A` and continue with the Fargate profile, subnet, pod, and controller checks.
4. If node groups are present, mark the cluster `HYBRID` and require a separately
  approved EC2 node-readiness assessment before claiming full readiness.

**Output:** Fargate profile status, selector coverage, profile subnets, and hybrid/N/A
boundary. Never report an empty Fargate node list as a clean kubelet-skew result.

## Score Impact

> **Canonical scoring is defined in `steering/report-generation.md` §Category 3 (Node Readiness) and §Category 10 (Unsupported Version).**

| Finding | Severity | Quick Reference |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| On extended support | INFO | 0 pts |
| Version UNSUPPORTED | CRITICAL | 15 pts (Category 10) |
| Multi-hop upgrade needed | INFO | 0 pts |
| Target version unreleased | N/A | Assessment aborted — no score |
| Fargate-only node readiness | N/A | 0 pts; AWS manages the runtime |
| Hybrid cluster with node groups | UNKNOWN | Requires separate EC2 node-readiness assessment |

I'm testing the EKS upgrade skill scoring logic with mock data. Do NOT run any aws or kubectl commands. Use the findings below as if you had already executed all checks.

Read `.claude/skills/eks-upgrade/steering/report-generation.md` for the scoring algorithm and report template, then generate the report.

This scenario is the CONTRAST to scenario 06: same containerd 1.x runtime, same target 1.36,
but the nodes are EKS-managed instead of self-managed. Managed node groups pull containerd
2.0+ automatically when the node group is upgraded to 1.36.

## Cluster Metadata

- Cluster: managed-platform
- Region: us-east-1
- Account: 666777888999
- Current Version: 1.35
- Target Version: 1.36
- Cluster Status: ACTIVE
- Assessment Date: 2026-06-18 15:00

## Findings from Assessment

### Version Validation (Step 1)
- Current: 1.35, Target: 1.36 — valid one-hop upgrade
- 1.35 is in STANDARD support (ends March 27, 2027)
- 1.36 exists on EKS (released June 2, 2026, STANDARD support)
- Node groups all at 1.35, skew against target = 1 (within policy)

### Breaking Changes (Step 2)
- No breaking changes apply (no gitRepo volumes, no IPVS mode, no externalIPs, canonical IPs)

### Deprecated APIs (Step 3)
- No removed APIs in use for 1.36

### Add-on Compatibility (Step 4)
- vpc-cni v1.21.0: ACTIVE, COMPATIBLE
- coredns v1.13.2: ACTIVE, COMPATIBLE
- kube-proxy v1.35.0: ACTIVE, COMPATIBLE
- aws-ebs-csi-driver v1.56.0: ACTIVE, COMPATIBLE
- Karpenter: not installed

### Node Readiness (Step 5)
- 1 node group: managed-ng — **EKS managed node group**, AL2023, version 1.35
- Nodes currently report **containerd 1.7.x** (older AL2023 AMI release)
- Node type: EKS managed node group (NOT self-managed, NOT custom AMI)
- Subnet IPs: subnet-aaa (40 available), subnet-bbb (38 available)
- Nodes run containerd 1.7.x; the node group is an EKS managed node group (not self-managed,
  not custom AMI). Upgrading the node group to 1.36 replaces the AMI and pulls containerd 2.0+
  automatically.

### Workload Risks (Step 6)
- 3 deployments in non-system namespaces:
  - web-app: replicas=3, RollingUpdate, probes present, requests present
  - api-gateway: replicas=2, RollingUpdate, probes present, requests present
  - worker: replicas=2, RollingUpdate, probes present, requests present
- PDBs exist for all three
- No drain-blocking PDBs

### AWS Upgrade Insights (Step 7)
- 4 insights, all PASSING

### AL2 / Behavioral
- No AL2 nodes
- No behavioral changes
